Manic Miner - Tao.Sdl

Changes so far:

0.20: Mostly the same as the 2011 version (translated to English, 
      1024 pixels wide):

  - 20 levels, with contents distribution similar (but not exact) to the 
    original ones, and still missing features, such as sliding floors and 
    fragile floors.
    
  - The player can move left, right and jump.
  
  - Enemies can move side to side or upside-down.
  
  - If the player picks all the items, they can advance to the next level.
  
  - If the player hits an enemy of an obstacle, they loose a life.
  
  - A couple of cheats included. For example, try to press T+N.
